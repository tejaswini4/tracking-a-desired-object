# tracking-a-desired-object
This project builds a tracker that could track an object that was selected by a bounding box. If the the object in the bounding box matches
with your one of the defined templates it would return the name of the template.

If you want to get the labels for your objects in the bounding box. Please store the images of those objects in the repository of this
notebook and name them as the name you want to label them. Also, don't forget to update the get_label() code with your templates.
